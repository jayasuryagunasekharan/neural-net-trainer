# Optimized Training Efficiency with TensorFlow

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing neural network training efficiency using TensorFlow. By implementing mini-batch training and optimizing weight updates through the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, the project achieved a 30% reduction in neural network training time, enhancing overall training speed. The model's flexibility was enhanced by supporting multiple loss functions, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Cross-Entropy, providing users with the ability to tailor the training process based on specific objectives. Additionally, the project implemented a validation split during training and monitored model performance on unseen data, resulting in a detailed record of average losses per epoch and accurate validation predictions.
